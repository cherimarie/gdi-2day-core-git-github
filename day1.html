          <section>
            <h3>What is version control?</h3>
            <p>Version control allows you (and your team) to do two powerful things</p>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Collaborate</h4>
              <p>Create anything with other people, from academic papers to entire websites and applications.</p>

              <h4>Track and revert changes</h4>
              <p>Mistakes happen. Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the changes that have been made and go "back in time" to fix something that went wrong?

            <p><span class ="green">2000s</span> -- SVN (Apache Subversion)</p>

            <h3>Version Control Types</h3>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Centralized Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: CVS, SVN</p>
              <p>One central server, each client (person) checks out and merges changes to main server</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fragment">
              <h4>Distributed Version Control</h4>
              <p>Examples: Git, Mercurial</p>
              <p>Each client (person) has a local repository, which they can then reconcile with the main server.</p>

          <p>Goals of Git Design</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fast -- add to your team and code base quickly</li>
            <li>Distributed (see slide above) - you can work without a network connection </li>
            <li>Each commit has a unique identifier, a SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm, a.k.a hash)</li>
            <li>Everyone has a local copy of the history</li>

          <p>An SSH key is like a secret handshake between your computer and Github. It allows Github's servers to verify your identity via public-key cryptography and challenge-response authentication- not via you typing in your Github password. It's super secure and not too difficult to set up. </p>

        <!-- First commands-->
        <section>
          <h3>Your first Local Repository</h3>
          <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">

cd ~
#or
cd Users\username

# create and move to a "working directory"

        <section>
          <h3>Add files</h3>
          <p>Create a new hello.txt file in your my-repo directory, then check repo status</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
touch hello.txt

        <!-- Explanation-->
        <section>
          <h3>What did we just do??</h3>
          <p>How is this all different than just saving a file?</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">When we <span class ="green">add</span> a file, we tell Git to track the current state of it. This is also known as 'staging' the file.</li>
            <li class="fragment">A <span class ="green">commit</span> saves changes made to staged files, not the whole files. The commit allows us to track which changes were committed when and by whom.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Look at our progress</h3>

          <p>Cool! We'll be using that SHA later...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Git is helpful</h3>
          <p>Always read the output of running git commands. They may look a little intimidating, but they contain all sorts of useful information. When in doubt, run:</p>
          <pre><code class="command-line">
git status
        </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Git flow</h3>
          <p>This is the general workflow in a Git repository</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git init            #just once, to initialize
      #do some stuff to files
git status          #what's up, git?
git add [filename]  #stage changes to a file
git commit -m ""    #commit a set of changes

          <div>
            <p>If you've added some new text to hello.txt, but not yet staged it, just run:</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Un-stage a file</h4>
          <p>If you already staged hello.txt, run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git reset hello.txt 
            </code></pre>
          <p>hello.txt is no longer staged, you can make whatever changes you like to it, and re-stage when it's ready.</p>

          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Delete a staged file</h4>
          <p>If you've already staged hello.txt, but want to delete it instead, run:</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git rm -f hello.txt
          </code></pre>
          <p>The file is deleted, and its deletion will be part of your commit.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undo staged changes</h4> 
            <p>If you've made some changes to hello.txt and staged it, but want the changes to disappear, run:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git reset hello.txt     #unstage
git checkout hello.txt  #reset
            </code></pre>
          <p>hello.txt is unstaged and reset to its state at the last commit - your changes are gone!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing committed changes- 1</h4> 
          <div>
            <p>If you've made changes and committed them, you can revert all the changes that happened in a specific commit by running:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git log             #shows log of commits 
git revert [SHA]    #undoes specified commit
            </code></pre>
            <p>This doesn't have to be your most recent commit- you can revert any commit. It will just undo the entire set of changes that were included in that commit.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Undoing Changes</h3>
          <h4>Undoing committed changes- 2</h4> 
          <div>
            <p>You can roll back your repo's state to where it was after any previous commit by running this with the SHA of the commit you'd like to reset to:</p>
            <pre><code contenteditable class ="command-line">
git log                 #shows log of commits 
git reset --hard [SHA]  #resets repo 
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This rolls back all changes since the specified commit - be careful! This isn't often used in real life.</p>
